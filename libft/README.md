# libft
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.
