## What is 42tokyo?
42 Tokyo (Forty Two) is an engineer training institution from France.
We provide engineer education around the world, including Silicon Valley, with the philosophy of "quality education for everyone who wants to take on challenges."
We are producing many engineers who are active in society with new systems such as facilities that can be used 24 hours a day, peer learning that overcomes problems between students, and completely free tuition fees.
